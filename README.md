Hi there, I am Esra ࣪ ִֶָ☾.

I am a security professional focused on Blue Team operations, proactive threat detection, and incident response. 

Currently, I manage 24/7 monitoring and security optimization for large-scale critical infrastructures.

Beyond standard security operations, I have a deep interest in low-level system internals, malware analysis, and vulnerability research. 

I enjoy diving into the depths of C, Assembly, and Kernel-level mechanisms to understand how threats operate at the architectural level.
